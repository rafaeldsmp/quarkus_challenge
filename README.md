## MICROMETER METRICS
Integration of Micrometer Metrics in Quarkus
Quarkus, renowned for its efficiency and rapid startup, gains considerable advantages from integrating with Micrometer Metrics, providing developers with a detailed and valuable insight into their application performance. By leveraging Micrometer Metrics in conjunction with Quarkus, it becomes feasible to monitor and collect a variety of essential metrics for the analysis and optimization of the application.
```shell script
http://localhost:8080/metrics
```
## Use Swagger UI for development
When building APIs, developers want to test them quickly. Swagger UI is a great tool permitting to visualize and interact with your APIs. The UI is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification.
``` shell script
http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui
```
## Running the application in dev mode
You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/desafio-quarkus-1.0-runner`
